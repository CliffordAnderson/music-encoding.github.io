Historical musical pieces make their way to us through multiple documents and it often happens that multiple sources introduce differences and variants in the music. meiView is a sample web application capable of displaying 15–16<sup>th</sup> century music (more precisely, the transcription of such music into common western music notation), and provide a dynamic mechanism for the user to select which variant they want to see.

For a demonstration of its capabilities, open [meiView](http://zolaemil.github.io/meiView/#score), and click on the green dots to see the differences between the sources. In the sidebar you can see the highlighted sources and variants you have selected. When you select a variant, the score automatically updates so that the selected variant is displayed.

With this application you can select an arbitrary combination of variants, effectively creating your own ‘edition’ or a customized ‘view’ of the music.
