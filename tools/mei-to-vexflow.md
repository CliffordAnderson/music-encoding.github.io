# MEI to VexFlow

[MEItoVexFlow](http://tei-music-sig.github.io/MEItoVexFlow/) is a JavaScript library which converts MEI-encoded music notation into drawing instructions for the open-source [VexFlow](http://vexflow.com) online music notation rendering API.

This library was first created by [Richard Lewis](https://github.com/ironchicken/MEItoVexFlow), then expanded as part of [The Lost Voices Project](http://digitalduchemin.org/). Most recently MEItoVexFlow has been improved on by [Zoltán Kőmíves](https://github.com/zolaemil) thanks to sponsorship from Google Summer of Code awarded to the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/) (MITH).

For a demonstration of the display capabilities of MEItoVexFlow, checkout the [feature demo](http://tei-music-sig.github.io/MEItoVexFlow/demo.html) page. The source code can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/MEItoVexFlow). [meiView](https://music-encoding.org/wordpress/?page_id=6#MEIView "Projects / Users") is an application that uses MEI to VexFlow in the context of textual variants in 15th and 16th century sources. It has been further enhanced thanks to funds from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu) and a Scholar Editions Grant from the [NEH](http://neh.gov/).
