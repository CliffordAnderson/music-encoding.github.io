# MEI to Music21 Converter

With the release of version 2.0, the [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) Python toolkit for musicology is now capable of importing MEI files. This release focuses on the features required for CMN scores, though it is hoped future versions will address more of MEI. To learn whether your favorite elements and attributes are supported, consult the [music21.mei module documentation](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/moduleReference/moduleMeiBase.html).

The module was primarily written by Christopher Antila with assistance from Andrew Hankinson, Ichiro Fujinaga, Myke Cuthbert, and the MEI-L mailing list. Funding for this project was provided by Canada's SSHRC as part of the [SIMSSA project](http://simssa.ca "Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis Project").
