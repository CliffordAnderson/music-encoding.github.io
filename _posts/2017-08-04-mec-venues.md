The venues and dates of the two forthcoming Music Encoding Conferences (MEC) have been announced.


**2018: 22 May to 25 May 2018, University of Maryland, College Park, USA**

The Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library (MSPAL) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) will host the Music Encoding Conference, May 22 - 25, 2018, at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, USA. The University of Maryland’s profile as a top-ranked public research institution, its vibrant music and performing arts culture, and its geographical proximity to Washington DC, make UMD an excellent venue for MEC.

**2019: 29 May to 1 June 2019, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria**

The Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Mozart Institute of the Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg and the Department of Musicology at the University of Vienna will jointly sponsor the 2019 conference, which will be held at the University of Vienna, in Vienna, Austria, May 29 - June 1, 2019\. As the “world capital of music”, a leading center of research, and a university city, Vienna is an ideal location for the conference.

Additional information about deadlines for submitting proposals, the organization of the conferences, etc. will be published early. Everyone interested in music encoding and related fields of work is welcome!
