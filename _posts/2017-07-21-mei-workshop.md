A free, three-day, hands-on MEI workshop will be offered Monday, October 2nd through Wednesday, October 4th, 2017 at the University of Virginia Library in Charlottesville, Virginia. 

Led by members of the Music Encoding Initiative Board and Technical Team, the workshop will consist of two parallel tracks – “Introduction to MEI” and “Advanced MEI”. 

**"Introduction to MEI"** In this track, those new to MEI will learn how to use the Music Encoding Initiative for research, teaching, electronic publishing, and management of digital collections. Major topics include

* basic XML;
* MEI history and design principles;
* tools for creating and editing MEI data and metadata;
* MEI-based workflows;
* and Verovio (www.verovio.org).

Each day will include lectures, hands-on encoding practice, and opportunities to address participant specific issues. Attendees are encouraged to bring example material they would like to encode. No previous experience with MEI or XML is required for this track, but an understanding of music notation and other markup schemes, such as TEI and HTML, will be helpful. 
 
**“Advanced MEI”** The intended audience for this track is software developers interested in creating software for authoring, editing, converting, querying, and rendering encoded music data. Topics to be covered include 

* the MEI specification and customizations; 
* conversion between MEI and other formats; 
* validation of MEI instances; 
* and MEI-specific libraries, such as lib-mei and Verovio. 

Proficiency in one or more programming languages as well as significant experience with music notation and XML development are required for participation in the advanced track. Due to the generous support of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, there is no cost for attending the workshop. However, each participant must bear his/her own travel, housing, and food costs. 

Light refreshments will be provided.
